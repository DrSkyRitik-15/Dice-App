# Dice Roll App

This repository contains a simple Dice Roll app built using Kotlin. The app is a fun and interactive way to simulate rolling a dice, making it a great practice project for learning Kotlin and Android development.

## Features
- **Dice Simulation**: Simulates the roll of a dice and displays a random number between 1 and 6.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface with a button to roll the dice.
- **Random Number Generation**: Uses Kotlin's Random class to generate dice roll outcomes.

## How to Use the App
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/DrSkyRitik-15/Dice-App/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/diceappp/MainActivity.kt>
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Connect an Android device or use an emulator.
4. Build and run the app.
5. Tap the "Roll Dice" button to generate a random dice roll.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Practiced Kotlin basics, including variables, functions, and classes.
- Used Android Studio to design layouts and develop an interactive app.
- Learned how to implement onClick listeners for button interactions.
- Worked with random number generation in Kotlin.

## Screenshots
(Add screenshots here if available.)

## Next Steps
- Enhance the UI with animations for the dice roll.
- Add multi-dice support for rolling two or more dice simultaneously.
- Implement themes and custom styles.
